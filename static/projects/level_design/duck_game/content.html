        <p>Duck Game is one of my favourite games, and making maps for it is one of my favourite things to do. If I could, I would do it all day every day. It's so much fun, and it's one of the games that completely cemented my love for level design.</p>
        <p>My friends think they're really fun and I love them all, so I decided to showcase a few of them here.</p>

        <p>The main thing with Duck Game maps is that they have to be short, easy to understand, fun, and challenging. Most of them have their own theme, and center around a specific weapon or obstacle, while others are just crazy and random. The key to Duck Game is variation so that you always get something different on the next map.</p>
        <p>On some maps I tried to push this concept further and created deathruns or maps where you just dodge ghosts and obstacles instead of trying to kill the other players.</p>
        <p>I also tried to come up with concepts and themes that no one else had done by combining Duck Game with my passion for history. This led me to design several levels set in Ancient Egypt and Babylon.</p>
        <p>The level design was done by me. The sand, sand-brick, and Babylonian textures used in some of these maps were made by a friend. All the other textures and weapons were made by the developer of Duck Game and by the developers of the UFF and DWEP mods.</p>
