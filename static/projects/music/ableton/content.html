        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>I finally decided to learn <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/" target="_blank">Ableton Live</a> in early 2021, after having focused mostly on FL Studio and Logic Pro, and I did so by messing around with the Trial version and making a bunch of cool song experiments to understand Live's flow.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These are the songs I made. It was so much fun!</p>

            <h1>War March</h1>

            <p>This was the very first song - and really the very first <em>thing</em> - I did in Live 11. I was browsing all the native instruments and I found this Upright Bass sample that I fell in love with. I instantly dragged it in and quickly wrote an ominus thumping bassline in C Major. To keep in line with my style and make sure things are never too simple, the bassline alternates between 4/4 and 3/4.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Looking for what could go along with this warlike vibe, I found a Horn Synth and tweaked it to make it sound more foreboding, and gave it a slow resounding melody. Then I added a high-pitched strident synth, and layered the bass again but with overdrive to have an intense climax.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sounds pretty badass if you ask me!</p>

            <h1>Blusey Jazzy Vibes</h1>
            <p>After that experiment, I wanted to make a full song in a genre I‚Äôm more familiar with. I‚Äôm always playing Blues on my guitar, so I decided to write a Blusey song with Jazz elements (or is it a Jazz song with Blues elements?). It alternates between a <em>12 Bar Blues</em> and a Jazz <em>ii V I</em> mostly in the key of E.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In contrast to <em>War March</em>, I aimed to make this song upbeat and happy and nice. Since the last project I‚Äôd worked on was Trigon Eternity, I was eager to try using a simple retro square wave synth in Ableton, but I didn‚Äôt want to it sound like the same thing again, so I layered the square wave synth with an electric Rhodes-style piano.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It‚Äôs a mix that works really well in my opinion! The roughness and sustain of the square synth complements the smooth reverberating electric piano very nicely.</p>

            <h1>Desert Vibe</h1>
            <p>I was a bit exhausted of thinking so much about music theory, and I wanted to learn the audio manipulation aspect of Ableton Live, so I decided to make something I had never done: a song using only built-in samples, and no MIDI instruments!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I listened through pretty much every single sample that comes with Live Suite, and made a list of all the ones I liked or could work with. It was actually quite a big list, so I split these into two different songs!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I started by laying down the basic drum groove, and overlaying more elements to create a more intersting and rich rhythm. I split this song into A/B sections to give it some structure and movement, using different beats and slightly different samples in each section. The groove had an African/Desert vibe and the default vocal samples did not fit at all, so the only ‚Äúthird-party‚Äù samples I brought in were vocal stems from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vACZA9dGvV4">Tinariwen</a>, a great band from the Sahara Desert.</p>

            <h1>Sample Song #2</h1>
            <p>The next Samples Song starts where the other one left off; literally, it starts with the train deperature sound at the end of Desert Vibe.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I wanted to take the concept a step further with this one. Instead of just doing a little mixing and chopping with the samples, I went all-in: chopped, re-ordered, reversed, and stretched them, and changed their pitch and tempo, etc. On some of them I added effects like overdrive, reverb, and delay. Both as a learning experience and to see how far I could go with just these few samples.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Like Desert Vibe, it‚Äôs split into A/B sections. For the A section, I took a fast jazz drum groove and slowed it way down, and added a ton of drive to a snare, to give this song a darker feel. Using only a couple of orchestra stab samples, I stretched, reversed, and changed pitch to make an entire melody out of it. For the B section, I took a single piano chord progression, and did all the same techniques to create completely different progressions.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I pretty much exhausted all the built-in samples I liked, so the Sample Song series ended here for now. It was a ton of fun to make them, and a cool new way to view music-making!</p>
