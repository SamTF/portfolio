        <p><b>Hat Boy: The Beginning</b> is a narrative puzzle game about exploring a strange underground world with two rival factions with ambiguous motivations that can't seem to see eye to eye... <b>where will you stand?</b> Your actions matter and will lead to one out of <b>seven different endings!</b></p>
        <p>Originally made as a super quick <a href="https://sebastiancc.itch.io/hat-boy" target="_blank">Bitsy game</a>, but I fell in love with the silly characters and world, so I decided to expand on it.</p>
        <p>The GameBoy remaster took about two weeks and was my first <b>real GameBoy game</b>. It was made using <a href="https://www.gbstudio.dev/" target="_blank">GB Studio</a>. It includes new and improvemed interactions, better UI and game feel, multiple endings, and most important of all... <b>music! ðŸŽ¶</b></p>
        <p>Story, Game Design, Programming, and Music were <b>all done by me</b>. Sound Effects are courtsey of Coffee Valen Bat on <a href="https://coffeevalenbat.itch.io/sweet-sounds-sfx-pack" target="_blank">itch.io</a>.</p>
        <p>I'm very happy with how it turned out and Chapter Two is already in the works!</p>
