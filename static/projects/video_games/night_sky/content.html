        <span class="short-text"><h1>Creation</h1></span>
        <p>I made this in 2015 when I was 15, and it was the first fully finished and standalone game I made! :)</p>
        <p>It’s very simple but elegant, and I’m very proud of it.</p>
        <p>I made it using the Construct 2 engine because it had a very intuitive “Microsoft Office”-like design which I was used to, and it had a logic based visual programming language. I didn’t have experience with actual written code but I figure out the logic and behaviours that I wanted to develop, so all in all it was perfect for me at the time. I made the entire thing myself over the course of a few weeks. I remember working on it in all my free time, as it was all I could think about.</p>
        <p>The hardest part was actually porting it over to an APK file that could run on Android. I made it happen though, and I even bought a Google Developer License to be able to publish Night Sky on the Play Store! There it managed to get several hundred downloads, but it was sadly removed from the store in 2018 because it required too many permissons :(</p>
        <p>This was due to the way Construct 2 and Cocoon export APK files, which was that I used to create Night Sky. It forced the app to need every single permission in order to work, despite the fact that my game didn’t need any of them at all. While I do still have all the APK files and Construct 2 project files saved safely, I’ve lost the secret Developer Key code that is used to “sign” APK files before they are allowed to be published, and the Cocoon platform was shut down years ago :(</p>
        <p>Thankfully, I can share the HTML5 version that can be played online. However it has a few bugs where the font will sometimes not work and the player’s coins aren’t tracked correctly. The mobile APK version also allowed for tilt controls, which is not possible in the browser version.</p>
        <p>All the game design, programming, and art were done by me. The music, sound effects, and font are royalty free and I got them online.</p>
