        <span class="short-text"><h1>Creation</h1></span>
        <p>This game was created as a university project with the theme of Experimentality combined with Impactful games. It was designed and programmed by myself and Theodore Menezes. He also did the art, while I focused in the music and sound effects.</p>
        <p>I had this idea in the back of my head for some time about making a game that looped in on itself after you beat, where each loop would contain the exact same enemies and level design, but your tools would change. This change in tools - not necessarily more powerful tools, just different ones – would lead to a different way of experiencing the game and exploiting the levels to your advantage: seeing the same thing from a perspective, and thus interacting with it differently.</p>
        <p>That’s where the core idea for this game came from. From there, we decided that making it about fighting the Coronavirus would be an interesting theme, given that we created this game while in quarantine, and so setting the game inside an infected human body was a natural conclusion.</p>
        <p>My favourite part was making the music, though! I made three different and distinct songs, which all share common themes (odd time signatures, polymeters, etc) and repeating motifs. This makes them all loop into each other seamlessly and feel part of the same coherent universe, while each song still has its own style.
