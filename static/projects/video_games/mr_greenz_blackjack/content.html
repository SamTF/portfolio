        <span class="short-text"><h1>Creation</h1></span>

        <h3>WHY?</h3>
        <p>I kept hearing from other <b>Grotto Beasts</b> enjoyers and collectors that they had nobody to play with in real life and therefore nothing to do with their <b>Grotto Beasts</b> cards <span class="faded">(besides displaying or eating)</span>. Thus, I set out to design a singleplayer game using the existing GB cards without any modification whatsoever.</p>

        <h3>HOW? / GAME DESIGN</h3>
        <p>This was a very interesting and new game design challenge for me: <b><i>I had to design a totally new game using existing cards designed for a very specific game without any modifications.</i></b></p>
        <p>I set myself the restriction of using the Grotto Beasts exactly as they are and having this game be playable in real life, so I had to keep the game simple and rely on what's already there. I wasn't going to make a solo "AI" to play Grotto Beasts, but instead a totally new game, so I pretty much discarded all the printed card effects, and therefore had to go with a <b>"numbers game"</b>: as numbers are all that's left on the card besides their text effect.</p>
        <p>Given that gambling and casinos are a big sub-theme in the Grotto Beasts world, I had to go for a <b>casino inspired game</b>, so I chose <i>Blackjack</i> because:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>it's an extremely simple game with room for extra mechanics</li>
            <li>it's Mr Greenz's iconic casino game of choice</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After playing around with various concepts and playtesting them myself with my cards, I came up with the gameplay system of <b>additive and multiplicative</b> score that's present in the final version <span class="faded">(refer to the video or help page to see it in action)</span>. In essence, it gives the game a lot of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b><i>strategy</i></b> - the cards you choose to play and even the order in which you play them matters</li>
            <li><b><i>flexibility</i></b> - as the required scores can be achieved with tons of different combinations.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After playtesting, this system seemed to be <b>perfectly playable</b> with all existing decks and even random combinations of cards, so I was very happy with the outcome.</p>

        <h3>DIGITAL VERSION / IRONY</h3>
        <p>Having a solid concept, I decided to share it with the Grotto Beasts community in the form of a game design document / manual. However, I realised that - while the game itself was pretty intuitive and fast - they found it hard to learn from the manual thus and was playing. So I figured I'd have to make a digital version on grotto.builders to onboard people into the game and show them how easy it is to play. I spent a few days designing the UI and giving it a lot of animations to feel alive and juicy <span class="faded">(inspired by Balatro)</span>.</p>
        <p>Then after a couple of weeks I implemented the game using <b>JS, HTML, and CSS</b> so it could be perfectly playable in the browser natively and directly embedded into <a href="/websites/grotto.builders" target="_blank">grotto.builders</a>. One key addition in the digital version was a <i>score preview</i> on a per-card basis, so players could see exactly <b>how the scoring worked in real-time</b>, making it much easier to learn and make combos.</p>
        <p>At this point, <b>people finally started playing the game</b>, with some even beating it much faster than I expected. People were enjoying it and I had fun working on it, so I kept adding more features to make it more interesting and replayable: such as adding <b>unique gameplay-altering effects to all Challengers</b>. By now, people were so comfortable with the digital version and its new features <span class="faded">(challenger effects and score previews)</span> that still nobody plays it in real life. Ironic! Oh well.</p>
