        <p>Will players strive to max out their stats or to create an artistic masterpiece as they fight a horde of monsters?</p>

        <p><em>“Letting Players Draw Their Own Character: Artistic Expression VS Gameplay Strategy”</em> was the Bachelor thesis which I wrote in June of 2023 to graduate from my Digital Games BA at the <a href="https://colognegamelab.de/" target="_blank">Cologne Game Lab</a>. Alongisde my game project <em><a href="https://sam.freelancepolice.org/video_games/chroma_mancer">Chroma Mancer</a></em>, it earned me the highest grade.</p>
        <p>The goal for this thesis was to observe how players would approach character creation in a video game where their gameplay stats are entirely based on how they create their character; as well as trying to understand if there is any underlying reason for their choices. This study was conducted with a sample size of 21 volunteer playtesters, using my game <em><a href="https://sam.freelancepolice.org/video_games/chroma_mancer">Chroma Mancer</a></em>. Would players focus on creating a unique and personalised character? Or would they not care at all and strive for maxing out their stats? Read my thesis to find out! :D</p>
        <p>Based on my findings<b>*</b>, the short and shocking answer is that:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><em><b>When given a blank canvas for avatar creation with gameplay significance, players will try to<br>
            create something aesthetically pleasing - even when they claim they didn’t intend to.</b></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This idea came about because there has been extensive literature written focusing solely on the visual appearance of a player’s avatar, without considering any gameplay implication of a player’s created character. My thesis aimed to address this glaring gap and shed light into a new area of player avatar research.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p id="disclaimer"><b>*</b><code>These observations are nevertheless not conclusive or universal, merely a first glimpse into this field, and more studies with larger participant groups are required.</code></p>
