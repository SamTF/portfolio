        <p><b>Chroma Mancer</b> is the game I created for my University graduation project and Bachelor Thesis. Together with the thesis, it earned me the <i>highest grade in university</i> (1.0 in the German system).</p>
        <p>I have written extensively about the development and creation process behind Chroma Mancer, which you can <a href="/static/projects/video_games/chroma_mancer/Chroma-Mancer-Documentation.pdf" target="_blank">read here</a>, so I will only very succinctly summarise my core ideas on this post.</p>
        <p>When choosing my theme, I knew I wanted to do something with <b>modding</b> - as modding games was the reason why I became interested and involved in game development when I was a kid. I wanted to make a moddable game, but with <b>modding as a core mechanic</b> of the gameplay loop. This led me to the idea of basing a character's gameplay stats on its sprite - because drawing new characters would be an extremely approacheable and intuitive way to modify the game - and thereby <b>linking aesthetical expression with gameplay stats</b>. Drawing and re-drawing the player sprite was now the key element of the game.</p>
        <p>This idea was also influenced by my observation that many modern games feature amazingly detailed character creators, but have a complete disconnect between the character you create and its gameplay attributes. I was curious what would happen if a character's stats were <b>inextricably linked to their visuals</b>. <i>How would players react to this?</i> To find out the shocking answer, make sure to read my thesis :)</p>
