        <p>This was a 4-person Game Design group project for university where we were tasked with designing a board game that would defy social conventions.</p>
        <p>We were aiming for a turn-based strategy game, and came up with the ideas that you play as the villains instead of the heroes, and that you have a shared pool of Action Points to split however you like between all players. This defies the convention of each person having their own reserved resources, and forces players to constantly discuss and plan, and be heavily involved in other players’ turns. Player cooperation is reinforced by the fact that there are 4 distinct character classes with their own abilities, and that every player must make it through to the exit, or everyone loses.</p>
        <p>Designed by  Daniel Baracotti, Lars Kalthoff, Sebastião Casaleiro, Theodore Menezes.</p>
