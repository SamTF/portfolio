        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Rat Game is a fast-paced turn-based competitive board game for two players where players take turns simultaneously, relying on quick decisions, luck, and mild strategy. The game is about fighting the opposing player over a series of quick matches on multiple levels, all with their unique themes and mechanics, using a varied array of weapons and items.</p>

<!-- Creation Process -->

    <div>
        <span class="full-text"><h1>Creation Process</h1></span>
        <span class="short-text"><h1>Creation</h1></span>
        
        <p>This was created for a university project where we just had to come up with any game, with no specific theme or concept.</p>
        <p>It is set in a universe where a mutated species of humanoid rats take over the world in a huge tide of vermin after aeons of planning for its conquest below ground. However, after having achieved their ultimate goal, the rats fragmented and started fighting each other over who would control this new world. Each player will take control of a rat trying to prove himself as a worthy leader.</p>
        <p>My main objective for this project was to create a very fast-paced and chaotic game that relied mostly on quick decisions, luck, and mild strategy, and that is played over a course of many different levels with unique mechanics and twists that force the players to adapt their playstyle and improvise on the go. I also aimed to have the rules be as simplified as possible and for the players to only need to keep track of a single variable (their weapon’s ammo) throughout the game, in order to make it easy to understand the game, for it to appeal to a wide-age range (from kids to adults), and for the game to be easy and quick to set-up and start playing.</p>
        <p>The game is played on maps made up of a 13x13 square grid. Each map is designed symmetrically, has a spawn point for each player, has unique obstacles and elements, and has item boxes where players can acquire either items specific to the map or random items. To keep the game fast paced, chaotic, and with as few variables to keep track of, there are no health points. Every weapon (that does damage) kills the player in a single hit.</p>
        <p>The game is split into two phases where both players act simultaneously:
        <br>    - movement phase
        <br>    - action phase</p>
        <p><strong>Movement phase:</strong>
        <br>This is where players move around the map, acquiring items from the item boxes and avoiding obstacles at the same time, within a 5 second timer. Each player has a movement range of 2 squares in any direction. An additional suqare of movement can be gained by rolling a D6 and getting a 4 or higher. Watch out though! You can’t move any farther after the 5 second timer is over.</p>
        <p>If a player lands on a tile with an item box, they get that item, and discard any items they might have previously had. Depending on the item box, this item will either be specifically defined, or will be drawn at random from the item deck.</p>
        <p><strong>Action phase:</strong>
        <br>This is when players shoot their guns, throw their grenades, or equip their gear, and activate any actions that their items might have. If players have a line of sight to each other and are in range, then they can shoot their guns once (unless specified otherwise); grenades don’t require a line of sight to be thrown. Grenades need to be activated, and will only blow up one turn after being activated. Like the Movement Phase, this is also done simultaneously, meaning that it’s possible for players to kill each other at the same time and end the match in a draw.</p>
        <p>Phew, that was a lot of text, but I really love this game! So much so that I’m working on a video game adaption! All the game design, level design, and narrative was done by me. The gun drawings on the cards were made by a friend.</p>
