        <p>This game was greatly inspired by one of my favourite boards: Space Hulk. Space Hulk is set in the Warhammer 40k universe and Games Workshop never made an equiavelent for the Warhammer Fantasy, so I decided to make my own version.</p>
        <p>The rules are similar, with several changes made to allow for the new settings, for more unique character classes, and for items. The biggest change was the ruleset of the enemies (the goblins) which was fully changed to allow for the interesting and fun mechanics derived from the goblinsâ€™ cowardliness and in-fighting.</p>
        <p>For this, I created these rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>goblins need to always be at distance from the dwarves until they outnumber them 4:1, or are rallied by the standard bearer or warboss</li>
            <li>goblins have a chance to hit each other when attacking, which will start in-fighting</li>
            <li>in-fighting only ends when only one goblin remains or the warboss steps in</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <p>Game design and level design by me. Artwork and 3D Models by Games Workshop.</p>
