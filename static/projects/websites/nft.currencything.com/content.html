        <p><strong><a href="http://nft.currencything.com">NFT.currencything.com</a></strong> is a full-stack Web3.0 dApp running on the Ethereum network through Polygon. It displays a collection of drawings I created, and allows each of them to be minted once and owned by any ethereum address. They can then be freely gifted to any address or put up for sale on the market for a price of your choosing, and allow other users to directly purchase your listed NFTs.</p>
        
        <p>This was the first Web3 and Smart Contracts project I made! I wanted to learn how Web3 dApps are made and how they interact with the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> blockchain through wallets like MetaMask and through Smart Contracts.
        I also wanted to understand how NFTs actually work behind the scenes, so I decided to learn all the basics of <a href="https://soliditylang.org/" target="_blank">Solidity</a>, Ethereum's programming language. After that, I was able comfortable with making my own Smart Contracts.
        Additionally, I wanted to become more familiar with the IPFS file protocol and have experience using it. The PNGs of the characters and their JSON metadata are hosted on IPFS through <a href="https://www.pinata.cloud/" target="_blank">Pinata</a> on their own CIDs.</p>

        <p>I decided to deploy the Smart Contracts to <a href="https://polygon.technology/" target="_blank">Polygon</a>, an Ethereum scaling solution, because it has much lower fees and faster transactions than the Ethereum mainnet. I deployed to Polygon's testnet, Mumbai, to be sure the smart contracts are battle hardened and work flawlessly, since they cannot be patched after deployment; also because it's free!</p>

        <p>As mentioned before, the frontend is running on <a href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" target="_blank">SvelteKit</a>. The characters were created by drawing six variations of each body part (hair, eyes, mouth), and then I wrote a <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a> script to create every possible combination of these parts.</p>
