        <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p><strong>Currencything.com</strong> is a full-stack website that tracks the Currency Thing blockchain, as well as graph several statistics about it and all its users. It has a Python back-end powered by Flask.</p>

        <span class="short-text"><h1>Creation</h1></span>

        <p><strong><a href="http://Currencything.com">Currencything.com</a></strong> is a full-stack website that displays the Currency Thing blockchain, from my Discord cryptocurrency experiment. It dynamically displays every transaction on the blockchain, updated every time a new transaction is made. It has the exact same format, except with an added date column (which is absent on Discord since it would be redundant).</p>
        <p>It features interesting statistics, like the total supply, amount of things mined and traded in the last X days, currency thing distribution among users, and the biggest trade. If you click on these statistic cards, it expands to reveal a graph tracking the value over all time, instead of just the last X days. I also added buttons at the top that allow you choose what time period to display stats for, which automatically refreshes the data without having to reload the page.</p>
        <p>You can click on any userâ€™s name in the blockchain to go to their profile, which contains similar statistics specific for that users, and also displays a table containing all transactions that they participated in.</p>
        <p>This website was made with a <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">Flask</a> back-end, and it was my first time using it. I wanted to have the codebase for this website in Python, to match the code of the Currency Thing discord bot, and Flask was the perfect solution. Itâ€™s extremely lightweight but powerful, and allows you have to variable URLs, so I just had to make a defalt user page template, then based on the username in the URL, Flask fetches all the relevant data to that user. Having Python as the back-end allowed me to use <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> for getting all sorts of data from the Blockchain, and using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> to create the graphs dynamically.</p>
        <p>I also added custom cursors and sound effects when you click things to keep things fun ðŸ¤¡.</p>
        <p>I had a great time making this website and loved all the things that Flask empowers you to do with a Python back-end, so much so that I decided to use Flask again to make my portfolio website youâ€™re browsing right now!</p>
