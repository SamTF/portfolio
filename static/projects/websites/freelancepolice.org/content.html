        <p>First website I ever made and hosted myself! It was my canvas for learning how CSS works, and served as the guinea pig I used to learn NGINX hosting on a Linux VM. Has OpenGraph/Twitter meta properties to look cool when you share the URL!</p>

        <p>I had been learning HTML and done some barebones ugly pages with very minimal styling, so I felt ready and motivated to take the next step and learn how to make webpages look nice! <a href="http://Freelancepolice.org">Freelancepolice.org</a> is basically my canvas where I threw CSS styles to see what would happen and try to make something of my own while I was at it.</p>
        <p>Since I already had a Linuz VM from Azure, I decided to also learn how to host a static website myself. I looked up the options, and it seemed NGINX was the prefered engine to use. After some configuring on NGINX and on Azure’s port forwarding settings, I was able to access the website over the internet using the VM’s IP address! It was very satisfying, so I decided to go ahead and buy a domain for the first time too! I got it from <a href="http://porkbun.com">porkbun.com</a>, and then just pointed it to the Linux VM’s IP address. So much learning in one single project!</p>
        <p>There’s no real content there right now, but in the future, once my friends have the time to get together on this, I plan on making <a href="http://freelancepolice.org">freelancepolice.org</a> a homepage for us and for our Discord server. In the mean time, I’m using it to host subdomains for other related websites, like <a href="http://emotes.freelancepolice.org">emotes.freelancepolice.org</a>.</p>
