        <p>This is a minimalist and light-hearted weather app, showing current conditions and forecasts for any city. Basically, a web app for <a href="/discord_bots/david_lynch">my Weather Report bot.</a></p>

        <span class="full-text"><h1>Creation Process</h1></span>
        <span class="short-text"><h1>Creation</h1></span>
        <p>I had already made all the code and designs required to create weather reports for any city when I created my Discord <a href="/discord_bots/david_lynch">Weather Report bot</a>, and I didn't want to limit to Discord; I wanted anyone to be able to use it from anywhere. Thus, I decided to create a web interface for the weather report API.</p>
        <p>To quickly summarise my Weather Reports, the main features are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Works for the majority of cities worldwide</li>
            <li>Show current temperature, conditions, and local time</li>
            <li>Shows tri-hourly forecasts for the entire day with a progression marker</li>
            <li>Forecasts hourly and average temp and conditions for tomorrow</li>
            <li>Minimalist and sleek, while also informative and readable design</li>
            <li>Cute icons made by me! ‚òÅÔ∏èüåû</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Weather Report website follows the same principles, featuring:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A simple interface</li>
            <li>Super fast responsiveness</li>
            <li>Light and Dark themes</li>
            <li>Page‚Äôs accent colour dynamically changes to match forecast</li>
            <li>Automatically generates weather card for the user's city</li>
            <li>Query the API directly using <code>/wttr/[city name]</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>I used Svelte for the front-end, and Python Flask for the back-end. The back-end API uses Pillow for generating the images, and comes from my David Lynch Weather Bot, with some tweaks made. All images and weather card design were made by me.</p>
